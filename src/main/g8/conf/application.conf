# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

# Uncomment the next line to enable PlayWS to use proxy properties (such as: http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort, http.nonProxyHosts, https.proxyHost, https.proxyPort)
# See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html
